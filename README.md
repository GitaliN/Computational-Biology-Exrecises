# Computational-Biology-Exrecises
Three programming exercises that built as part of the course CB. Implemented in python.

Ex1 - Construction of a cellular automaton that mimics the spread of the corona virus.
Ex2 - Solving "Nonogram" boards using genetic algorithms.
EX 3 - Application of the SOM neural network on digits. Given an example of a digit, learning of the digit and later attempting to reproduce it.
